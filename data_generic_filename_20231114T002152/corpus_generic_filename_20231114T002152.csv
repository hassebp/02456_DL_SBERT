9,"Several effective interventions are available for preventing HIV in women. Targeting interventions requires understanding their risk of acquiring HIV. We used surveillance data to estimate risks of HIV acquisition for 13–59-year-old women following a diagnosis of syphilis, gonorrhoea or chlamydia in Florida during 2000–2009. 
We excluded women reported with HIV before their STI, and measured HIV reported subsequent to STI (through 2011). Rates were compared to women with no reported STI. A total of 328,456 women had: syphilis (3325), gonorrhoea (67,784) or chlamydia (257,347). During 2,221,944 person-years of follow-up, 2118 of them were diagnosed with HIV. 
For women with no STI reported, during 64,763,832 person-years, 19,531 were reported with HIV. The crude rate of subsequent HIV diagnosis (per 100,000 person-years) was higher for women diagnosed with syphilis (597.9), gonorrhoea (171.3) or chlamydia (66.3) than women with no STI (30.2). Annual rates of HIV decreased over-all by 61.8% between 2001 and 2011. 
Women with syphilis or gonorrhoea were at highest risk for HIV and therefore might benefit from intensive counselling. However, they represented only a small fraction of the women who acquired HIV. Most cases of HIV infection among women occurred among the large group of women who were not at highest risk."
13,"This study investigated the effect of handle stability on maximum push/pull force. It was hypothesized that people apply force in directions deviated from the pure push/pull direction to generate a moment that assists producing greater push/pull force when the handle position is fixed (stable) compared to when it is not fixed (unstable). 
Eight healthy subjects performed maximum push and pull exertions on a stable and an unstable handle in a seated posture, while maximum push/pull force, vertical force, and lateral force were recorded. For the unstable handle, vertical and lateral forces were not different from zero during push and pull. 
For the stable handle, subjects intuitively applied significant downward force during push and significant upward force during pull exertions. As predicted from biomechanical analysis, this downward and upward force was found to be significantly associated with increased push and pull force, respectively, for the stable handle compared to the unstable handle."
18,"We investigate the association between perceived everyday discrimination and psychological distress among urban African-American women with young children (under 6 years) living in low-income neighborhoods. Specifically, we examine whether instrumental and emotional social support moderates the association between perceived everyday discrimination and psychological distress. 
The data come from the Detroit Dental Health Project, a two-stage area probability sample representative of low-income African-American children in the city of Detroit. The analysis focuses on 969 female caregivers of young children. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine the role of social support in the link between perceived everyday discrimination and psychological distress, with appropriate adjustments for the complex sample design. 
Both moderate and high frequency levels of discrimination were associated with higher levels of psychological distress after controlling for age, education, income, and self-rated health. There was a main effect of emotional support so that availability of emotional support was associated with less psychological distress. 
Instrumental support exerted a buffering effect to mitigate the negative influence of moderate levels of perceived discrimination on psychological distress. Findings suggest that instrumental social support provides some protection from everyday stress. Social support, however, does not offset the impact of acute stress caused by frequent perceptions of everyday discrimination."
19,"The Kilimanjaro region has one of the highest rates of reported alcohol use per capita in Tanzania. Alcohol-related risky behaviors pose substantial threats to the health and well-being of alcohol users and the people around them. This study seeks to understand how alcohol-related risky behaviors co-occur with other risky behaviors. 
Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to examine alcohol-related risky behaviors. The optimal number of latent classes was confirmed by using model fit indices. Negative binomial models were used to test latent classes and their association with harmful and hazardous drinking and perceived alcohol stigma. 
With the model defined, we explored each class's drinking patterns and risky behavior patterns. A total of 622 (60% male) of 841 participants were included in these analyses because they drank alcohol at least once in their lifetime. Three classes of risky behavior patterns were identified: Class 1, ""Limited risk behaviors"" (59.7%); Class 2, ""Primarily foolish behaviors"" (25.6%); and Class 3, ""Pervasive risk behaviors"" (13.1%). 
Class 3 had the most alcohol use quantity and frequency. No association between classes and alcohol stigma was found. Compared with males, females are less likely to be classified in Class 2 and 3. Three different classes of risky behaviors became apparent and were distinguished by gender, age, and personal alcohol use. 
Our findings suggest a potential role for personalized interventions based on latent classes specifically to reduce risk behaviors."
45,"What is the issue?
         Oxytocin is a natural hormone, which causes the uterus (womb) to have regular, painful contractions and labour to start. It is available as an intravenous (into a vein (IV)) drug and infused slowly to artificially stimulate labour if doctors or midwives feel that it is necessary to accelerate the birth of the baby, or if the mother requests it. 
In Western countries, about one in four pregnant women have labour induced, usually with prostaglandin drugs either alone or in combination with oxytocin. Risks associated with using IV oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractions include the woman having contractions that are too long or too frequent (uterine hyperstimulation), which can lead to changes in the baby’s heart rate and the need for emergency caesarean. 
This review examines whether stopping IV oxytocin once labour is well‐established (i.e. the cervix is dilated more than halfway) reduces the associated risks for mother and baby compared to continuing with IV oxytocin.           Why is this important?
         Stopping oxytocin infusion once active labour has started could result in a more natural childbirth, particularly if the risk of uterine overstimulation and need for immediate caesarean section is reduced. 
Also, the overall total dose of oxytocin the mother received would be reduced, which could lead to fewer adverse effects (e.g. maternal nausea, vomiting and headache, or changes to the baby's heart rate).           What evidence did we find?
         We searched for evidence (January 2018) and found 10 randomised controlled studies (1888 women and their babies) conducted between February 1998 and January 2016 at hospitals in Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Iran, USA, Bangladesh, India, and Thailand. 
We cannot be confident in the results because of study design limitations and how the findings were reported. Stopping IV oxytocin during active labour may reduce the number of women who have a caesarean section (nine trials, 1784 women). However, when we performed another analysis including only those women who were actually in active labour, we found that there is probably little or no difference between the two groups (four trials, 787 women). 
Discontinuing IV oxytocin probably reduces the risk of women having contractions that become too long or too strong resulting in changes to the baby’s heart rate (three trials, 486 women). We are uncertain about whether stopping IV oxytocin or not affects the risk of having a bacterial infection of the membranes or sac inside the womb) (one trial, 252 women). 
Stopping IV oxytocin during labour may have little or no impact on women’s use of analgesia and epidural compared to women who continued to receive IV oxytocin (three trials, 556 women). There were probably fewer babies in the discontinued IV oxytocin group with abnormal cardiotocography results (an electronic method of measuring both the women’s contractions and the baby’s heartbeat) compared to women who continued to receive IV oxytocin (seven trials, 1390 women). 
Compared to continued IV oxytocin, discontinuing IV oxytocin probably has little or no impact on the number of babies with a low score on a standard test of well‐being for newborn babies (Apgar), five minutes after being born (four trials, 893 women), or another other measure of infant well‐being involving analysing blood taken from the umbilical cord once (four trials, 873 women). 
The included trials did not report on many of this review's outcomes, including death of the mother or her baby.           What does this mean?
         Stopping oxytocin after the active phase of labour has started may reduce the number of women with contractions that become too long or too strong resulting in changes to the baby’s heart rate, and the risk of having a caesarean. 
However, the possible reduction in the risk of caesarean may be an artefact of poor study design. Better quality trials are needed. These could include in the analysis those women who did not reach the active phase of labour because their babies were delivered earlier by caesarean, and those whose labour was so rapid that the oxytocin could not be stopped in time, i.e. analysis should be by 'intention‐to‐treat"". 
Future studies could include the outcomes listed in this review, including women's satisfaction."
48,"The E1-glycoprotein (Mr = 26,014; 228 amino acids) of mouse hepatitis virus A59 is a class III membrane glycoprotein which has been used in this study as a model system in the study of membrane integration and protein transport. The protein lacks an NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence and spans the viral membrane three times. 
Hydrophobic domains I and III could serve as signal sequences for cotranslational membrane integration. Domain I alone was sufficient to translocate the hydrophilic NH2 terminus of E1 across the membranes as evidenced by glycosylation of a newly introduced N-glycosylation site. The COOH-terminal part of E1 involving amino acids Leu124 to Thr228 was found to associate tightly with membranes at the post-translational level, although this part of the molecule lacks pronounced hydrophobic sequences. 
Membrane protection assays with proteinase K showed that a 2-kDa hydrophilic fragment was removed from the COOH terminus of E1 indicating that the protein is largely embedded into the membrane. Microinjection of in vitro transcribed capped and polyadenylated mRNA into CV-1 cells or into secretory AtT20 pituitary tumor cells showed that the E1-protein accumulated in the Golgi but was not detectable at the plasma membrane or in secretory granules. 
The 28 NH2-terminal hydrophilic amino acid residues play no role in membrane assembly or in intracellular targeting. Various NH2-terminal portions of E1 were fused to Ile145 of the cytoplasmic N-protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The resulting hybrid proteins were shown to assemble into membranes in vitro and were detected either in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or transient vesicles of microinjected cells."
50,"There has been an increasing focus on late functional effects of head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of late proximal esophageal stricture in patients undergoing total laryngectomy (TL) and radiation therapy (RT). An institutional retrospective review of HNC patients treated between 1995 and 2003 with TL and RT was undertaken. 
Thirty-three patients with stage II–IV disease were included; 25 patients had TL and postoperative RT (group 1), while 8 patients had definitive RT with salvage laryngectomy (group 2). The median follow-up was 28 months. At the last follow-up, 25 patients (76%) were alive and disease free. Four had died and 3 developed distant metastasis. 
Dysphagia or stenosis developed in 40% in group 1 and 75% in group 2 patients. The median time to dysphagia was 5.5 months for all patients. The incidence of esophageal stenosis was 33% for all patients. Contributing factors for esophageal stenosis after TL and RT include continued alcohol and tobacco use, the dose-volume relationship of the RT and normal tissue damage from the tumor and the treatment."
