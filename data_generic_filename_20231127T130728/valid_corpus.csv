93;"Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules have several functions in pancreatic islets, including provision of mechanical support and prevention of cytotoxicity during inflammation. During islet isolation, ECM connections are damaged, and are not restored after encapsulation and transplantation. Inclusion of specific combinations of collagen type IV and laminins in immunoisolating capsules can enhance survival of pancreatic islets. 
Here we investigated whether ECM can also enhance survival and lower susceptibility of human islets to cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity. To this end, human islets were encapsulated in alginate with collagen IV and either RGD, LRE or PDSGR, i.e. laminin sequences. Islets in capsules without ECM served as control. 
The encapsulated islets were exposed to IL-1Î², IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± for 24 and 72â€…h. All combinations of ECM improved the islet cell survival, and reduced necrosis and apoptosis after cytokine exposure (P <â€…0.01). Collagen IV-RGD and collagen IV-LRE reduced danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release from islets (P <â€…0.05). 
Moreover, collagen IV-RGD and collagen IV-PDSGR, but not collagen IV-LRE, reduced NO release from encapsulated human islets (P < 0.05). This reduction correlated with a higher oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of islets in capsules containing collagen IV-RGD and collagen IV-PDSGR. Islets in capsules with collagen IV-LRE showed more dysfunction, and OCR was not different from islets in control capsules without ECM. 
Our study demonstrates that incorporation of specific ECM molecules such as collagen type IV with the laminin sequences RGD and PDSGR in immunoisolated islets can protect against cytokine toxicity."
17;"Negative interactions between species can generate divergent selection that causes character displacement. However, other processes cause similar divergence. We use spatial and temporal replication across island populations of Anolis lizards to assess the importance of negative interactions in driving trait shifts. 
Previous work showed that the establishment of Anolis sagrei on islands drove resident Anolis carolinensis to perch higher and evolve larger toepads. To further test the interaction's causality and predictability, we resurveyed a subset of islands nine years later. Anolis sagrei had established on one island between surveys. 
We found that A. carolinensis on this island now perch higher and have larger toepads. However, toepad morphology change on this island was not distinct from shifts on six other islands whose Anolis community composition had not changed. Thus, the presence of A. sagrei only partly explains A. carolinensis trait variation across space and time. 
We also found that A. carolinensis on islands with previously established A. sagrei now perch higher than a decade ago, and that current A. carolinensis perch height is correlated with A. sagrei density. Our results suggest that character displacement likely interacts with other evolutionary processes in this system, and that temporal data are key to detecting such interactions."
48;"The biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis causes smut disease on maize (Zea mays), which is characterized by immense plant tumours. To establish disease and reprogram organ primordia to tumours, U.Â maydis deploys effector proteins in an organ-specific manner. However, the cellular contribution to leaf tumours remains unknown. 
We investigated leaf tumour formation at the tissue- and cell type-specific levels. Cytology and metabolite analysis were deployed to understand the cellular basis for tumourigenesis. Laser-capture microdissection was performed to gain a cell type-specific transcriptome of U.Â maydis during tumour formation. 
In vivo visualization of plant DNA synthesis identified bundle sheath cells as the origin of hyperplasic tumour cells, while mesophyll cells become hypertrophic tumour cells. Cell type-specific transcriptome profiling of U.Â maydis revealed tailored expression of fungal effector genes. Moreover, U.Â maydis See1 was identified as the first cell type-specific fungal effector, being required for induction of cell cycle reactivation in bundle sheath cells. 
Identification of distinct cellular mechanisms in two different leaf cell types and of See1 as an effector for induction of proliferation of bundle sheath cells are major steps in understanding U.Â maydis-induced tumour formation. Moreover, the cell type-specific U.Â maydis transcriptome data are a valuable resource to the scientific community."
1;"Objectives Precarious employment (PE) is a term used to describe non-standard employment forms characterized by low security that may have negative effects on mental health. The objective of this review was to systematically review the evidence for effects of PE on mental health and identify important areas for further research. 
Methods A protocol was developed following PRISMA-P guidelines. Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched up to 4 September 2017. All unique records were assessed for eligibility and quality by at least two reviewers. Data from included studies were summarized in forest plots and meta-analyses using a random-effects model. 
Evidence quality was rated using the GRADE method. Results We obtained 3328 unique records, of which 16 studies of sufficient quality met the inclusion criteria. Moderate quality evidence (GRADE score 3 of 4) was found for an adverse effect of job insecurity on mental health; summary odds ratio (OR) 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.70]. 
There was very low quality (GRADE 1 of 4) evidence for effects of temporary employment or unpredictable work hours on mental health. Five studies on multidimensional exposures all showed adverse effects, weighted average OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.60-2.53). Conclusions Research on PE and mental health is growing, but high-quality prospective studies are still scarce. 
Job insecurity likely has an adverse effect on mental health. A clear multi-dimensional definition of PE is lacking, and harmonization efforts are needed. Further single-variable observational studies on job insecurity or temporary employment should not be prioritized."
47;"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. 
Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. 
COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases. 
Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks."
16;"Supplying phytolith-rich biochar in agrosystems increases soil pH, CEC and nutrient availability, adding to the impact of Si uptake on plant growth. Here we studied this specific impact as influenced by soil properties, and assessed the role of phytoliths to provide plant available Si. We used a young Cambisol and a highly weathered, poorly buffered, desilicated Nitisol. 
The biochars were produced from rice plants respectively enriched (Si+) and depleted (Si-) in Si. They had identical pH and nutrient contents, but largely differed in Si content (51.3Â g Si kgâˆ’1 in Siâ€‰+â€‰vs 0.3Â g Si kgâˆ’1 in Si-). We compared their effects to that of wollastonite (CaSiO3) on the biomass and mineralomass of wheat plants in a soil:solution:plant device. 
The contents of soil bioavailable Si and biogenic Si were assessed through an original CaCl2 kinetic extraction and the DeMaster Na2CO3 alkaline dissolution, respectively. The DeMaster technique dissolved Si from phytolith as well as from wollastonite. The soil buffering capacity (cmolc kgâˆ’1) was 31 in the Cambisol and 0.2 in the Nitisol. 
An identical supply of phytolithic biochar increased pH from 4.5 to 4.8 in the Cambisol, and from 4.8 to 7.4 in NI. It further increased the content of bioavailable Si (from 55 to 97Â mgÂ kgâˆ’1 in the Cambisol, and 36 to 209Â mgÂ kgâˆ’1 in the Nitisol), as well as plant Si uptake, biomass and Si mineralomass. 
That increase was largest in the Nitisol. The DeMaster technique did not specifically quantify the phytolith pool. This pool was the main source of plant available Si in both the Cambisol and Nitisol amended with phytolithic biochar. At identical phytolithic Si supply, however, soil pH and soil buffering capacity controlled the transfer of Si in the soil-plant system, which was largest in the poorly buffered Nitisol. 
The effect of phytolithic biochar on Si bioavailability was depending on soil constituents and properties, and thus on soil type."
