25;"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the largest type of lung cancer (LC) with a higher mortality rate. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in cancer progression. Therefore, this study was to explore the function of hsa_circ_0043265 in NSCLC. The expression levels of hsa_circ_0043265, microRNA-25-3p (miR-25-3p) and forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 
Ribonuclease R (RNase R) and Actinomycin D (ActD) were used to verify the authenticity and stability of hsa_circ_0043265. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry and transwell assays were used to evaluate the abilities of proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Also, Western blot (WB) analysis was performed to assess the levels of apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferation-related proteins and FOXP2 protein. 
RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the interaction between miR-25-3p and hsa_circ_0043265 or FOXP2. Besides, mice xenograft models were constructed to confirm the effect of hsa_circ_0043265 on NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Hsa_circ_0043265 was lowly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cells, and its overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT process, while improved the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. 
MiR-25-3p could be sponged by hsa_circ_0043265, and its overexpression could invert the suppression effect of overexpressed-hsa_circ_0043265 on NSCLC progression. Moreover, FOXP2 was a target of miR-25-3p, and its silencing also could reverse the inhibition effect of overexpressed-hsa_circ_0043265 on NSCLC progression. 
In addition, hsa_circ_0043265 overexpression reduced the tumor growth of NSCLC in vivo. Hsa_circ_0043265 could sponge miR-25-3p to improve FOXP2 expression, thereby inhibiting NSCLC progression. This study showed that hsa_circ_0043265 could be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of NSCLC."
62;"To make research responsible and research outcomes meaningful, it is necessary to communicate our research and to involve as many relevant stakeholders as possible, especially in application-oriented-including information and communications technology (ICT)-research. Nowadays, stakeholder engagement is of fundamental importance to project success and achieving the expected impact and is often mandatory in a third-party funding context. 
Ultimately, research and development can only be successful if people react positively to the results and benefits generated by a project. For the wider acceptance of research outcomes, it is therefore essential that the public is made aware of and has an opportunity to discuss the results of research undertaken through two-way communication (interpersonal communication) with researchers. 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations regarding research and innovation, aims to foster inclusive and sustainable research and innovation. Research and innovation processes need to become more responsive and adaptive to these grand challenges. 
This implies, among other things, the introduction of broader foresight and impact assessments for new technologies beyond their anticipated market benefits and risks. Therefore, this article provides a structured workflow that explains ""how to develop a stakeholder engagement plan"" step by step."
105;"This paper analyzes an emergent stream of research shedding light on the institutional factors shaping entrepreneurial activity and its effect on economic growth. This integrative analysis spanning a broad spectrum of diverse literature enables a distinction between two different research lines in the field of entrepreneurship. 
The findings of this study, based on articles from the journals included in the Web of Science database, facilitate a broader comprehension of two separate lines of research, which allows an analysis of the interaction among institutions, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. The systematic literature analysis over the last 25Â years (1992â€“2016) of research reveals that institutions could be related to economic growth through entrepreneurship, which would open new research questions about what institutional factors are conducive to entrepreneurship, which in turn spurs economic growth. 
Thus, not only is understanding both complex relationships and their possible sequence useful for planning strategies and public policies, but it is also helpful for advancing and providing new insights in these research fields, which could be complementary and interdisciplinary."
24;"The axillary lymph node status is an important prognostic factor of breast cancer. This study explores the predictive factors for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis among the preoperative clinicopathological features, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). This study comprised patients diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent surgery at Nagasaki Harbor Medical Center between April 2014 and December 2019. 
The factors assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses were the clinicopathological data of these cancers, including the patient age, gender, menstrual status, breast or ovarian cancer family history, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, clinical tumor size, nipple-tumor distance (NTD), tumor histology, histological grade, node status, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 status, and Ki67 labeling index. 
In the cohort of 313 cases, the ratio of SLN metastasis was 17.3%. A univariate analysis found that the tumor size, NTD, IGT, and clinical tumor stage were associated with SLN metastasis. In a multivariable analysis, the tumor size, NTD, and IGT were associated with SLN metastasis. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a sensitivity and specificity of 61.1% and 65.6%, respectively, at a cut-off of 1.7 cm for the tumor size (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.664; 95% confidence interval: 0.592-0.736), and a sensitivity and specificity of 60.4% and 62.9%, respectively, at a cut-off of 2.0 cm for NTD (AUC: 0.651; 95% confidence interval: 0.571-0.731) to predict the risk of SLN metastasis. 
T1 and T2 breast cancer patients with a larger tumor size, tumor located closer to the nipple, and IGT have a higher risk of SLN metastases than others."
14;"Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) is a rare tumor, comprising less than 10% of sinonasal malignancies. SNMM most frequently occurs in the nasal cavity (70%) and maxillary sinus (14%), typically as black patches. Overall, SNMM harbors a very poor prognosis; 5-year survival is less than 30%. Nasal cavity tumors confer a better prognosis than sinus melanoma. 
The primary management for SNMM is surgery, when feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Recent studies suggest that immunotherapy may confer survival benefit to patients with advanced disease. The multidisciplinary team approach has been shown to optimize treatment, reduce costs, and minimize adverse events, while maximizing the chances for cure."
53;"Visual signals attractive to friends may also attract enemies. Â The bright colors of anthers and pollen have generally been thought to attract pollinators. We hypothesize that visual crypsis of anthers, and particularly pollen, should be favored in flowering plants because protection from pollen collectors reduces the loss of male gametes. 
To understand adaptive strategies relating to the color of pollen, we measured the color of pollen, undehisced anther sacs, and their background, the corolla, with a spectrometer for 104 insect-pollinated flowering species from a natural community in Hengduan Mountains, southwest China. The colors of anthers, pollen and corollas were diverse in these species. 
The color diversity of exposed pollen was significantly higher than that of concealed pollen (i.e. where anthers are enclosed or shielded by corollas). The color contrast between pollen and corolla was significantly smaller in species with exposed pollen than in those with concealed pollen. Unlike anther color, exposed pollen color tended to match its background corolla color. 
Our phylogenetic comparative analysis showed contrasting effects of pollen color patterns between flowers with exposed pollen and those with concealed pollen, revealing a strategy of hiding pollen from pollen thieves via visual crypsis."
95;"The question of how the probabilistic opinions of different individuals should be aggregated to form a group opinion is controversial. But one assumption seems to be pretty much common ground: for a group of Bayesians, the representation of group opinion should itself be a unique probability distribution (Madansky [44]; Lehrer and Wagner [34]; McConway Journal of the American Statistical Association, 76(374), 410â€“414, [45]; Bordley Management Science, 28(10), 1137â€“1148, [5]; Genest et al. 
The Annals of Statistics, 487â€“501, [21]; Genest and Zidek Statistical Science, 114â€“135, [23]; Mongin Journal of Economic Theory, 66(2), 313â€“351, [46]; Clemen and Winkler Risk Analysis, 19(2), 187â€“203, [7]; Dietrich and List [14]; Herzberg Theory and Decision, 1â€“19, [28]). We argue that this assumption is not always in order. 
We show how to extend the canonical mathematical framework for pooling to cover pooling with imprecise probabilities (IP) by employing set-valued pooling functions and generalizing common pooling axioms accordingly. As a proof of concept, we then show that one IP construction satisfies a number of central pooling axioms that are not jointly satisfied by any of the standard pooling recipes on pain of triviality. 
Following Levi (Synthese, 62(1), 3â€“11, [39]), we also argue that IP models admit of a much better philosophical motivation as a model of rational consensus."
83;"Healthcare professionals may have certain psychological characteristics which contribute to increasing the quality of their professional performance. Study the effect that humanization of care and communication have on the burnout syndrome in nursing personal. The sample included a total of 330 Spanish nurses. 
Analytical instruments used were the Health Professional's Humanization Scale (HUMAS), Communication Styles Inventory Revised (CSI-R) and Brief Burnout Questionnaire Revised (CBB-R). Two broad nursing profiles could be differentiated by their level of humanization (those with scores over the mean and those with scores below it in optimistic disposition, openness to sociability, emotional understanding, self-efficacy, and affection), where the largest group had the high scores. 
A communication repertoire based on verbal aggressiveness impacted indirectly on the effect of humanization on burnout, mainly in the personal impact component. We observed the relation of humanization profiles in nursing staff with the job dissatisfaction and burnout components. Besides that, some communication styles, verbal aggressiveness and questioningness, have an indirect effect on the relationship between humanization profiles and job dissatisfaction. 
The results on the relationship between communication styles and burnout, and the mediator effect of communication styles on the relationship between humanization of care and burnout in nursing personnel are discussed."
79;"Policy Points Social prescribing is proposed as a way of improving patients' health and well-being by attending to their non-clinical needs. This is done by connecting patients with community assets (typically voluntary or charitable organizations) that provide social and personal support. In the United Kingdom, social prescribing is used to improve patient well-being and reduce use of National Health Service resources. 
Although social prescribing schemes hold promise, evidence of their effects and effectiveness is sparse. As more information on social prescribing is gathered, it will be important to consider the associated ethical issues for patients, clinicians, link workers, and community assets."
46;"Increasing global atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has a considerable impact on soil respiration. Due to different carbon dioxide (CO2) resources of different components of soil respiration, there may be different mechanisms by which soils respond to N additions. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of N additions on total soil respiration (RST), rhizospheric respiration (RSR) and heterotrophic respiration (RSH), and to elucidate the potential causal mechanisms. 
An artificial N addition experiment was conducted in an evergreen broad-leaved forest at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin in China. The effects of three N treatment levels (+0, +50, +150Â kgÂ NÂ haâˆ’1Â yr.âˆ’1) were measured, with the N application initiated in April 2013. Trenching method was used for partitioning RST into RST and RSR. 
The values of RST and its components were measured monthly from May 2015 to April 2016. The mean annual RST was 1.92â€‰Â±â€‰0.18Â Î¼mol CO2 mâˆ’2Â sâˆ’1, with RSH and RSR contributing 75â€‰Â±â€‰1% and 25â€‰Â±â€‰1% to RST, respectively. Nitrogen addition significantly reduced RST and its two components, as well as the contribution of RSR to RST. 
Microbial biomass carbon (C) and pH in bulk soil decreased significantly after N application. Nitrogen addition had no effect on rhizospheric soil biochemical properties. RSR was significantly positively correlated with root biomass of Castanopsis platyacantha, while RSH was significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN) for bulk soil. 
The positive correlation between RSR and root biomass indicates that N application reduced RSR by reducing belowground C allocation and thus C inputs to the rhizosphere. The value of RSH decreased primarily due to a reduction in microbial activity and soil organic matter decomposition in root-free soil after N was added. 
The presence of plant roots may mitigate the effect of N inputs to the rhizosphere via alteration of root morphology and exudates."
34;"Although methotrexate (MTX) is an effective immunosuppressive and anti-cancer agent, it is associated with side effects, including nephrotoxicity. Capsaicin, a component of hot chilli peppers, induces rapid desensitization of TRPV1 pain receptors and therefore has uses in pain treatment. Capsaicin also has anti-cancer activity, including anti-inflammatory properties. 
Thus, capsaicin may have potential in preventing MTX-induced nephrotoxicity. The purpose of this research work was to observe protective effects of capsaicin towards renal toxicity caused by methotrexate and mechanisms responsible for these effects. As expected, capsaicin had nephroprotective effects in MTX-intoxicated rats. 
Serum creatinine urea, nitric oxide (NO) and renal malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased significantly, with a concurrent increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and renal glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities as compared to rats that had been untreated with nephrotoxic. Biochemical analyses confirmed the protective effects of capsaicin. 
We conclude that capsaicin provides protection against MTX-nephrotoxicity in rats via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities."
102;"Plant functional traits regulate ecosystem functions but little is known about how co-occurring gradients of land use and edaphic conditions influence their expression. We test how gradients of logging disturbance and soil properties relate to community-weighted mean traits in logged and old-growth tropical forests in Borneo. 
We studied 32 physical, chemical and physiological traits from 284 tree species in eight 1Â ha plots and measured long-term soil nutrient supplies and plant-available nutrients. Logged plots had greater values for traits that drive carbon capture and growth, whilst old-growth forests had greater values for structural and persistence traits. 
Although disturbance was the primary driver of trait expression, soil nutrients explained a statistically independent axis of variation linked to leaf size and nutrient concentration. Soil characteristics influenced trait expression via nutrient availability, nutrient pools, and pH. Our finding, that traits have dissimilar responses to land use and soil resource availability, provides robust evidence for the need to consider the abiotic context of logging when predicting plant functional diversity across human-modified tropical forests. 
The detection of two independent axes was facilitated by the measurement of many more functional traits than have been examined in previous studies."
9;"Cells express a family of three inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks). Although sharing the same enzymatic activity, individual IP6Ks mediate different cellular processes. Here we report that IP6K3 is enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells where it associates with dynein intermediate chain 2 (DIC2). 
Using immunofluorescence microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we found that DIC2 and IP6K3 are recruited interdependently to the leading edge of migrating cells, where they function coordinately to enhance the turnover of focal adhesions. Deletion of IP6K3 causes defects in cell motility and neuronal dendritic growth, eventually leading to brain malformations. 
Our results reveal a mechanism whereby IP6K3 functions in coordination with DIC2 in a confined intracellular microenvironment to promote focal adhesion turnover."
49;"Radium-223 (Ra223) prolongs the survival and improves the quality of life of men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to bones. However, compared to other mCRPC therapies, using Ra223 comes with its unique challenges. Hence, we aimed to identify Ra223 utilization patterns under real-world conditions, as well as factors predicting treatment completion and outcome. 
In this retrospective chart analysis, 198 mCRPC patients were identified that had received Ra223 outside of clinical trials or access programs from January 2015 to October 2016 at four cancer centres in Ontario. The main outcomes studied were Ra223 completion rate, reasons for early treatment discontinuation, overall survival, and survival differences in patients completing Ra223 therapy versus patients receiving <6 cycles of Ra223. 
In addition, patient and disease characteristics were analysed to identify predictors of treatment completion and survival. In this cohort of patients mostly pretreated with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (92.4%), almost half of which had also received docetaxel (48.5%), the Ra223 completion rate was 46.5%, and the actuarial median survival was 13.3 months. 
The main reason for early Ra223 discontinuation was disease progression, and Ra223 non-completion was associated with poorer outcome (median survival 8.1 months [6.0-12.2] versus 18.7 months [15.3-22.3] in men completing Ra223, p<0.0001). Lymph node metastases and a high baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were independent predictors of early treatment discontinuation. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models revealed early Ra223 discontinuation, baseline anemia, high PSA, prior skeletal-related events, visceral metastases, and being referred to another centre for Ra223 therapy as predictors of worse outcome. Despite a lower completion rate than observed under clinical trial conditions, the real-world results achieved with Ra223 are encouraging. 
If prospectively validated, predictive patient and disease characteristics identified in our cohort might become instrumental to identify mCRPC patients likely to complete and to most benefit from Ra223 therapy."
44;"What causes the disparity in biodiversity among regions is a fundamental question in biogeography, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Evolutionary and biogeographic processes (speciation, extinction, dispersal) directly determine species richness patterns, and can be studied using integrative phylogenetic approaches. 
However, the strikingly high richness of East Asia relative to other Northern Hemisphere regions remains poorly understood from this perspective. Here, for the first time, we test two general hypotheses (older colonization time, faster diversification rate) to explain this pattern, using the plant tribe Lysimachieae (Primulaceae) as a model system. 
We generated a new time-calibrated phylogeny for Lysimachieae (13 genes, 126 species), to estimate colonization times and diversification rates for each region and to test the relative importance of these two factors for explaining regional richness patterns. We find that neither time nor diversification rates alone explain richness patterns among regions in Lysimachieae. 
Instead, a new index that combines both factors explains global richness patterns in the group and their high East Asian biodiversity. Based on our results from Lysimachieae, we suggest that the high richness of plants in East Asia may be explained by a combination of older colonization times and faster diversification rates in this region."
26;"Childhood maltreatment (CM) comprises experiences of abuse and neglect during childhood. CM causes psychological as well as biological alterations in affected individuals. In humans, it is hardly explored whether these CM consequences can be transmitted directly on a biological level to the next generation. 
Here, we investigated the associations between maternal CM and mitochondrial bioenergetics (mitochondrial respiration and intracellular mitochondrial density) in immune cells of mothers and compared them with those of their newborns. In n = 102 healthy mother-newborn dyads, maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neonatal umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were collected and cryopreserved shortly after parturition to measure mitochondrial respiration and intracellular mitochondrial density with high-resolution respirometry and spectrophotometric analyses, respectively. 
Maternal CM was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Maternal and neonatal mitochondrial bioenergetics were quantitatively comparable and positively correlated. Female newborns showed higher mitochondrial respiration compared to male newborns. Maternal CM load was significantly and positively associated with mitochondrial respiration and density in mothers, but not with mitochondrial respiration in newborns. 
Although maternal and neonatal mitochondrial bioenergetics were positively correlated, maternal CM only had a small effect on mitochondrial density in newborns, which was not significant in this study after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The biological relevance of our finding and its consequences for child development need further investigation in future larger studies. 
This study reports data on mitochondrial bioenergetics of healthy mother-newborn dyads with varying degrees of CM."
19;"Scholars interested in the relationship between social context and health have recently turned attention further ""upstream"" to understand how political, social, and economic institutions shape the distribution of life chances across contexts. We compare minority health inequalities across 22 European countries ( N = 199,981) to investigate how two such arrangements-welfare state effort and immigrant incorporation policies-influence the distribution of health and health inequalities. 
We examine two measures of health from seven waves of the European Social Survey. Results from a series of multilevel mixed-effects models show that minority health inequalities vary across contexts and persist after accounting for socioeconomic differences. Cross-level interaction results show that welfare state effort is associated with better health for all groups but is unrelated to levels of inequality between groups. 
In contrast, policies aimed at protecting minorities from discrimination correlate with smaller relative health inequalities."
31;"Plants regularly encounter patchily distributed soil nutrients. A common foraging response is to proliferate roots within high-quality patches. The influence of the social environment on this behaviour has been given limited attention, despite important fitness consequences of competition for soil resources among plants. 
Using the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), we compared localized root proliferation in a high-quality patch by plants grown alone to that of plants in two different social environments: with a neighbouring plant sharing equal access to the high-quality patch, and with a neighbouring plant present but farther from the high-quality patch such that the focal individual was in closer proximity to the high-quality patch. 
Sunflowers grown alone proliferated more roots within high-nutrient patches than lower-nutrient soil. Plants decreased root proliferation within a high-nutrient patch when it was equidistant to a neighbour. Conversely, plants increased root proliferation when they were in closer proximity to the patch relative to a nearby neighbour. 
Such contingent responses may allow sunflowers to avoid competition in highly contested patches, but to also pre-empt soil resources from neighbours when they have better access to a high-quality patch. We also compared patch occupancy by sunflowers grown alone with two equidistant high-quality patches to occupancy by sunflowers grown with two high-quality patches and a neighbour. 
Plants grown with a neighbour decreased root length within shared patches but did not increase root length within high-quality patches they were in closer proximity to, perhaps because resource pre-emption may be less important for individuals when resources are more abundant. These results show that nutrient foraging responses in plants can be socially contingent, and that plants may account for the possibility of pre-empting limited resources in their foraging decisions."
38;"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine or immune globulin (IG) effectively prevents infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) when administered within 2 weeks of exposure. Preexposure prophylaxis against HAV infection through the administration of HepA vaccine or IG provides protection for unvaccinated persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate HAV endemicity. 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence for administering vaccine for PEP to persons aged >40 years and reviewed the HepA vaccine efficacy and safety in infants and the benefits of protection against HAV before international travel. 
The February 21, 2018, ACIP recommendations update and supersede previous ACIP recommendations for HepA vaccine for PEP and for international travel. Current recommendations include that HepA vaccine should be administered to all persons aged â‰¥12 months for PEP. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be administered to persons aged >40 years depending on the provider's risk assessment. 
ACIP also recommended that HepA vaccine be administered to infants aged 6-11 months traveling outside the United States when protection against HAV is recommended. The travel-related dose for infants aged 6-11 months should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose series. The dosage of IG has been updated where applicable (0.1 mL/kg). 
HepA vaccine for PEP provides advantages over IG, including induction of active immunity, longer duration of protection, ease of administration, and greater acceptability and availability."
78;"We investigate the quantum thermodynamical properties of localised relativistic quantum fields, and how they can be used as quantum thermal machines. We study the efficiency and power of energy transfer between the classical gravitational degrees of freedom, such as the energy input due to the motion of boundaries or an impinging gravitational wave, and the excitations of a confined quantum field. 
We find that the efficiency of energy transfer depends dramatically on the input initial state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of the system to extract energy from a gravitational wave and store it in a battery. This process is inefficient in optical cavities but is significantly enhanced when employing trapped Bose Einstein condensates. 
We also employ standard fluctuation results to obtain the work probability distribution, which allows us to understand how the efficiency is related to the dissipation of work. Finally, we apply our techniques to a setup where an impinging gravitational wave excites the phononic modes of a Bose Einstein condensate. 
We find that, in this case, the percentage of energy transferred to the phonons approaches unity after a suitable amount of time. These results give a quantitative insight into the thermodynamic behaviour of relativistic quantum fields confined in cavities."
97;"Late-maturity alpha-amylase (LMA) is a wheat genetic defect causing the synthesis of high isoelectric point alpha-amylase following a temperature shock during mid-grain development or prolonged cold throughout grain development, both leading to starch degradation. While the physiology is well understood, the biochemical mechanisms involved in grain LMA response remain unclear. 
We have applied high-throughput proteomics to 4,061 wheat flours displaying a range of LMA activities. Using an array of statistical analyses to select LMA-responsive biomarkers, we have mined them using a suite of tools applicable to wheat proteins. We observed that LMA-affected grains activated their primary metabolisms such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; TCA cycle, along with DNA- and RNA- binding mechanisms; and protein translation. 
This logically transitioned to protein folding activities driven by chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, as well as protein assembly via dimerisation and complexing. The secondary metabolism was also mobilized with the upregulation of phytohormones and chemical and defence responses. LMA further invoked cellular structures, including ribosomes, microtubules, and chromatin. 
Finally, and unsurprisingly, LMA expression greatly impacted grain storage proteins, as well as starch and other carbohydrates, with the upregulation of alpha-gliadins and starch metabolism, whereas LMW glutenin, stachyose, sucrose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-glucose were downregulated. To our knowledge, this is not only the first proteomics study tackling the wheat LMA issue but also the largest plant-based proteomics study published to date. 
Logistics, technicalities, requirements, and bottlenecks of such an ambitious large-scale high-throughput proteomics experiment along with the challenges associated with big data analyses are discussed."
21;"Although congenital nonunion of the clavicle is a well-known pathology in children, posttraumatic nonunion is a rare entity. Nonunion after open reduction and internal fixation of a clavicle fracture is exceptional in the pediatric population. We report on a patient presenting posttraumatic pseudarthrosis of the clavicle after surgical treatment. 
Pseudarthrosis was resected, and the defect was bridged with an iliac crest autograft, supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein, and fixed with an elastic stable intramedullary nail. This procedure offered enough stability for achieving fracture consolidation and is a safe alternative to plating in clavicle nonunion."
81;"Reviewing the results of several decades of excavation in the center of Melbourne, Australia, provides the opportunity to reflect on what archaeological evidence has to contribute to understandings of the colonial city. The city has been shaped by its role as a colonial entrepot, a gold rush port, and a nineteenth-century metropolitan center. 
Its rich archaeological record derives from the intersection of heritage controls and a development boom. Data from archaeological excavations drives new perspectives on Melbourne itself, revealing a city intimately connected with the gold rush boom that fuelled its growth. Archaeological data also shed light on the specific and distinctive historical circumstances that influenced the development of cities established in the nineteenth century, including transnational migration and trade along with emerging concerns over public health and sanitation."
92;"Some people experience prolonged symptoms following an acute COVID-19 infection including fatigue, chest pain and breathlessness, headache and cognitive impairment. When symptoms persist for over 12 weeks following the initial infection, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis, the term post-COVID-19 syndrome is used, or the patient-defined term of Long Covid. 
Understanding the lived experiences of Long Covid is crucial to supporting its management. However, research on patient experiences of Long Covid is currently not ethnically diverse enough. The study aim is to explore the lived experience of Long Covid, using qualitative interviews and art-based methods, among people from ethnically diverse backgrounds (in the UK), to better understand wider systems of support and healthcare support needs. 
Co-created artwork will be used to build on the interview findings. A purposive sampling strategy will be used to gain diverse experiences of Long Covid, sampling by demographics, geographic locations and experiences of Long Covid. Individuals (aged >18 years) from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds, who self-report Long Covid symptoms, will be invited to take part in a semi-structured interview. 
Interviews will be analysed thematically. A sub-sample of participants will be invited to co-create visual artwork to further explore shared narratives of Long Covid, enhance storytelling and increase understanding about the condition. A patient advisory group, representing diversity in ethnicity and experiences of Long Covid, will inform all research stages. 
Stakeholder workshops with healthcare professionals and persons, systems or networks important to people's management of Long Covid, will advise on the integration of findings to inform management of Long Covid. The study will use patient narratives from people from diverse ethnic backgrounds, to raise awareness of Long Covid and help inform management of Long Covid and how wider social systems and networks may inform better healthcare service access and experiences."
35;"Atherosclerosis is a major cardiovascular disease that causes ischemia of the heart, brain, or extremities, and can lead to infarction. The hypolipidemic agent atorvastatin calcium (Ato) alleviates atherosclerosis by reducing plasma lipid and inflammatory factors. However, the low bioavailability of Ato limits its widespread use and clinical effectiveness. 
Curcumin (Cur), a natural polyphenol with antioxidation and anti-inflammation bioactivities, has potential anti-atherosclerosis activity and may reduce Ato-induced cytotoxicity. Liposomes modified using a targeting ligand (E-selectin-binding peptide) were prepared to co-deliver Ato and Cur to dysfunctional endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing E-selectin. 
Molecules involved in the inhibition of adhesion (E-selectin and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) and inflammation (IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP-1]) in human aortic endothelial cells were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining. 
The antiatherosclerosis effects of liposomes co-loaded with Ato and Cur in vivo were evaluated using ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. Targeted liposomes delivered Ato and Cur to dysfunctional ECs, resulting in synergistic suppression of adhesion molecules (E-selectin and ICAM-1) and plasma lipid levels. 
Moreover, this treatment reduced foam cell formation and the secretion of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and MCP-1) by blocking monocyte migration into the intima. In addition, Cur successfully reduced Ato-inducible cytotoxicity. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that cell-targeted co-delivery of Ato and Cur to dysfunctional ECs drastically reduces atherosclerotic lesions with fewer side effects than either Ato or Cur alone."
72;"Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer, with an impressive efficacy and safety profile. Cytopenia is the main adverse event, which is both predictable and manageable. 
Here, we report a case of CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced vitiligo-like lesions. Vitiligo or vitiligo-like lesions are a rare adverse event; only a few cases are reported in the literature. A 71-year-old female patient was diagnosed initially with early-stage right breast cancer (HR+/HER2-) and was treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. 
A few years later, she developed metastatic disease to the hilar lymph nodes, and to multiple skeletal sites, including the left scapula, left shoulder, left iliac bone, and dorsal vertebrae, for which she was treated with ribociclib and letrozole. While on treatment, she developed hypopigmented lesions involving both hands, feet, and face, which were described as vitiligo-like lesions. 
CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced vitiligo is a rare and unpredictable adverse event. This case report highlights the rarity of this adverse event, the dilemma related to the optimal treatment, and decisions related to continuation, holding, or switching CDK4/6 inhibitors."
6;"The diabetes drug metformin has recently been shown to possess anti-cancer properties when used with other chemotherapeutic drugs. However, detailed mechanisms by which metformin improves cancer treatment are poorly understood. Here we provide evidence in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells that metformin sensitizes cisplatin-resistant HepG2 cells (HepG2/DDP) through increasing cellular glycolysis and suppressing Nrf2-dependent transcription. 
We show that metformin increases glucose uptake and enhances glucose metabolism through glycolytic pathway, resulting in elevated concentrations of intracellular NADPH and lactate. Consistently, high glucose medium suppresses Nrf2-dependent transcription and sensitizes HepG2/DDP cells to cisplatin. Elevated glycolysis was required for metformin to regulate Nrf2-dependent transcription and cisplatin sensitivity, as inhibition of glycolysis with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) significantly mitigates the beneficial effect of metformin. 
Together, our study has revealed an important biological process and gene transcriptional program underlying the beneficial effect of metformin on reducing chemo-resistance in HepG2 cells and provided new information on improving chemotherapy of liver cancers."

However, the use of disposable instruments is associated with increased solid waste production and may have negative impacts on the environment, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions. 
The purpose of this study was to inform this discussion; we applied life cycle assessment methods to evaluate the carbon footprints of 3 vaginal specula: a single-use acrylic model and 2 reusable stainless steel models. The functional unit of the study was defined as the completion of 20 gynecologic examinations by either type of speculum. 
The greenhouse gas emissions (eg, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) across all life cycle stages, which includes material production and manufacturing, transportation, use and reprocessing, and end-of-life, were analyzed with the use of SimaPro life cycle assessment software and converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. 
The reusable stainless steel grade 304 speculum was found to have a lesser carbon footprint over multiple model scenarios (different reprocessing techniques, autoclave loading/efficiency, and number of uses) than either the reusable stainless steel grade 316 or the disposable acrylic specula. The material production and manufacturing phase contributed most heavily to the total life cycle carbon footprint of the acrylic speculum, whereas the use and reprocessing phase contributed most to the carbon footprints of both stainless steel specula. 
The use of disposable vaginal specula is associated with increased greenhouse gas equivalents compared with reusable alternatives with no significant difference in clinical utility. These findings can be used to inform decision-making by healthcare systems, because they weigh a wide range of considerations in making final purchase decisions; similar analytic methods can and should be applied to other components of health systems' waste streams."
3;"Fine-scale information about urban vegetation and social-ecological relationships is crucial to inform both urban planning and ecological research, and high spatial resolution imagery is a valuable tool for assessing urban areas. However, urban ecology and remote sensing have largely focused on cities in temperate zones. 
Our goal was to characterize urban vegetation cover with sub-meter (<1 m) resolution aerial imagery, and identify social-ecological relationships of urban vegetation patterns in a tropical city, the San Juan Metropolitan Area, Puerto Rico. Our specific objectives were to (1) map vegetation cover using sub-meter spatial resolution (0.3-m) imagery, (2) quantify the amount of residential and non-residential vegetation, and (3) investigate the relationship between patterns of urban vegetation vs. socioeconomic and environmental factors. 
We found that 61% of the San Juan Metropolitan Area was green and that our combination of high spatial resolution imagery and object-based classification was highly successful for extracting vegetation cover in a moist tropical city (97% accuracy). In addition, simple spatial pattern analysis allowed us to separate residential from non-residential vegetation with 76% accuracy, and patterns of residential and non-residential vegetation varied greatly across the city. 
Both socioeconomic (e.g., population density, building age, detached homes) and environmental variables (e.g., topography) were important in explaining variations in vegetation cover in our spatial regression models. However, important socioeconomic drivers found in cities in temperate zones, such as income and home value, were not important in San Juan. 
Climatic and cultural differences between tropical and temperate cities may result in different social-ecological relationships. Our study provides novel information for local land use planners, highlights the value of high spatial resolution remote sensing data to advance ecological research and urban planning in tropical cities, and emphasizes the need for more studies in tropical cities."
2;"High parental self-efficacy (PSE) has been associated with healthy diets and higher levels of physical activity (PA) in children; however, data on PSE in relation to body weight and body composition are scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate associations of PSE with measures of diet, PA, body composition, and physical fitness in early childhood. 
We used baseline data from the MINISTOP trial in healthy Swedish children ( n = 301; 4.5 Â± 0.15 years). PSE was assessed using a questionnaire, dietary data were collected using a mobile technology-assisted methodology, and PA was obtained (sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous) by accelerometry. 
Body composition was measured using the pediatric option for BodPod and cardiorespiratory fitness by the 20 m shuttle run. Linear regression was conducted to evaluate cross-sectional associations of the outcomes in relation to total PSE and scores computed for the individual PSE factors: (1) diet, (2) limit setting of unhealthful behaviors, and (3) PA. 
Higher scores of total PSE and the diet factor were associated with higher fruit intake (Î² = 0.82 g/point and 1.99 g/point; p = .014 and .009, respectively) and lower consumption of unhealthy snacks (Î² = -0.42 g/point and -0.89 g/point; p = .012 and .020, respectively) after adjustment for parental body mass index and education, respondent, and child's sex and age. 
No associations were observed between PSE and PA, body composition, or cardiorespiratory fitness. Our study noted that PSE should be considered in conjunction with other strategies for a sustainable impact on childhood obesity."
