1;"Objectives Precarious employment (PE) is a term used to describe non-standard employment forms characterized by low security that may have negative effects on mental health. The objective of this review was to systematically review the evidence for effects of PE on mental health and identify important areas for further research. 
Methods A protocol was developed following PRISMA-P guidelines. Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched up to 4 September 2017. All unique records were assessed for eligibility and quality by at least two reviewers. Data from included studies were summarized in forest plots and meta-analyses using a random-effects model. 
Evidence quality was rated using the GRADE method. Results We obtained 3328 unique records, of which 16 studies of sufficient quality met the inclusion criteria. Moderate quality evidence (GRADE score 3 of 4) was found for an adverse effect of job insecurity on mental health; summary odds ratio (OR) 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.70]. 
There was very low quality (GRADE 1 of 4) evidence for effects of temporary employment or unpredictable work hours on mental health. Five studies on multidimensional exposures all showed adverse effects, weighted average OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.60-2.53). Conclusions Research on PE and mental health is growing, but high-quality prospective studies are still scarce. 
Job insecurity likely has an adverse effect on mental health. A clear multi-dimensional definition of PE is lacking, and harmonization efforts are needed. Further single-variable observational studies on job insecurity or temporary employment should not be prioritized."
2;"High parental self-efficacy (PSE) has been associated with healthy diets and higher levels of physical activity (PA) in children; however, data on PSE in relation to body weight and body composition are scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate associations of PSE with measures of diet, PA, body composition, and physical fitness in early childhood. 
We used baseline data from the MINISTOP trial in healthy Swedish children ( n = 301; 4.5 ± 0.15 years). PSE was assessed using a questionnaire, dietary data were collected using a mobile technology-assisted methodology, and PA was obtained (sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous) by accelerometry. 
Body composition was measured using the pediatric option for BodPod and cardiorespiratory fitness by the 20 m shuttle run. Linear regression was conducted to evaluate cross-sectional associations of the outcomes in relation to total PSE and scores computed for the individual PSE factors: (1) diet, (2) limit setting of unhealthful behaviors, and (3) PA. 
Higher scores of total PSE and the diet factor were associated with higher fruit intake (β = 0.82 g/point and 1.99 g/point; p = .014 and .009, respectively) and lower consumption of unhealthy snacks (β = -0.42 g/point and -0.89 g/point; p = .012 and .020, respectively) after adjustment for parental body mass index and education, respondent, and child's sex and age. 
No associations were observed between PSE and PA, body composition, or cardiorespiratory fitness. Our study noted that PSE should be considered in conjunction with other strategies for a sustainable impact on childhood obesity."
3;"Fine-scale information about urban vegetation and social-ecological relationships is crucial to inform both urban planning and ecological research, and high spatial resolution imagery is a valuable tool for assessing urban areas. However, urban ecology and remote sensing have largely focused on cities in temperate zones. 
Our goal was to characterize urban vegetation cover with sub-meter (<1 m) resolution aerial imagery, and identify social-ecological relationships of urban vegetation patterns in a tropical city, the San Juan Metropolitan Area, Puerto Rico. Our specific objectives were to (1) map vegetation cover using sub-meter spatial resolution (0.3-m) imagery, (2) quantify the amount of residential and non-residential vegetation, and (3) investigate the relationship between patterns of urban vegetation vs. socioeconomic and environmental factors. 
We found that 61% of the San Juan Metropolitan Area was green and that our combination of high spatial resolution imagery and object-based classification was highly successful for extracting vegetation cover in a moist tropical city (97% accuracy). In addition, simple spatial pattern analysis allowed us to separate residential from non-residential vegetation with 76% accuracy, and patterns of residential and non-residential vegetation varied greatly across the city. 
Both socioeconomic (e.g., population density, building age, detached homes) and environmental variables (e.g., topography) were important in explaining variations in vegetation cover in our spatial regression models. However, important socioeconomic drivers found in cities in temperate zones, such as income and home value, were not important in San Juan. 
Climatic and cultural differences between tropical and temperate cities may result in different social-ecological relationships. Our study provides novel information for local land use planners, highlights the value of high spatial resolution remote sensing data to advance ecological research and urban planning in tropical cities, and emphasizes the need for more studies in tropical cities."
4;"CDC recommends a number of mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Those behaviors include 1) covering the nose and mouth with a mask to protect others from possible infection when in public settings and when around persons who live outside of one's household or around ill household members; 2) maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance from persons who live outside one's household, and keeping oneself distant from persons who are ill; and 3) washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or, if soap and water are not available, using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (1). 
Age has been positively associated with mask use (2), although less is known about other recommended mitigation behaviors. Monitoring mitigation behaviors over the course of the pandemic can inform targeted communication and behavior modification strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Data Foundation COVID Impact Survey collected nationally representative data on reported mitigation behaviors during April-June 2020 among adults in the United States aged ≥18 years (3). 
Reported use of face masks increased from 78% in April, to 83% in May, and reached 89% in June; however, other reported mitigation behaviors (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, and avoiding public or crowded places) declined marginally or remained unchanged. At each time point, the prevalence of reported mitigation behaviors was lowest among younger adults (aged 18-29 years) and highest among older adults (aged ≥60 years). 
Lower engagement in mitigation behaviors among younger adults might be one reason for the increased incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this group, which have been shown to precede increases among those >60 years (4). These findings underscore the need to prioritize clear, targeted messaging and behavior modification interventions, especially for young adults, to encourage uptake and support maintenance of recommended mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
6;"The diabetes drug metformin has recently been shown to possess anti-cancer properties when used with other chemotherapeutic drugs. However, detailed mechanisms by which metformin improves cancer treatment are poorly understood. Here we provide evidence in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells that metformin sensitizes cisplatin-resistant HepG2 cells (HepG2/DDP) through increasing cellular glycolysis and suppressing Nrf2-dependent transcription. 
We show that metformin increases glucose uptake and enhances glucose metabolism through glycolytic pathway, resulting in elevated concentrations of intracellular NADPH and lactate. Consistently, high glucose medium suppresses Nrf2-dependent transcription and sensitizes HepG2/DDP cells to cisplatin. Elevated glycolysis was required for metformin to regulate Nrf2-dependent transcription and cisplatin sensitivity, as inhibition of glycolysis with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) significantly mitigates the beneficial effect of metformin. 
Together, our study has revealed an important biological process and gene transcriptional program underlying the beneficial effect of metformin on reducing chemo-resistance in HepG2 cells and provided new information on improving chemotherapy of liver cancers."
8;"Polyphenols have long been recognized as health-promoting entities, including beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease, but their reputation has been boosted recently following a number of encouraging clinical studies in multiple chronic pathologies, that seem to validate efficacy. Health benefits of polyphenols have been linked to their well-established powerful antioxidant activity. 
This review aims to provide comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge on the current therapeutic status of polyphenols having sufficient heed towards the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, data about the safety profile of highly efficacious polyphenols has also been investigated to further enhance their role in cardiac abnormalities. 
Evidence is presented to support the action of phenolic derivatives against cardiovascular pathologies by following receptors and signaling pathways which ultimately cause changes in endogenous antioxidant, antiplatelet, vasodilatory, and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, in vitro antioxidant and pre-clinical and clinical experiments on anti-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory attributes of polyphenols have revealed their role as cardioprotective agents. 
However, an obvious shortage of in vivo studies related to dose selection and toxicity of polyphenols makes these compounds a suitable target for clinical investigations. Further studies are needed for the development of safe and potent herbal products against cardiovascular diseases. The novelty of this review is to provide comprehensive knowledge on polyphenols safety and their health claims. 
It will help researchers to identify those moieties which likely exert protective and therapeutic effects towards cardiovascular diseases."
9;"Cells express a family of three inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks). Although sharing the same enzymatic activity, individual IP6Ks mediate different cellular processes. Here we report that IP6K3 is enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells where it associates with dynein intermediate chain 2 (DIC2). 
Using immunofluorescence microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we found that DIC2 and IP6K3 are recruited interdependently to the leading edge of migrating cells, where they function coordinately to enhance the turnover of focal adhesions. Deletion of IP6K3 causes defects in cell motility and neuronal dendritic growth, eventually leading to brain malformations. 
Our results reveal a mechanism whereby IP6K3 functions in coordination with DIC2 in a confined intracellular microenvironment to promote focal adhesion turnover."
13;"Ecology and biomechanics play central roles in the generation of phenotypic diversity. When unrelated taxa invade a similar ecological niche, biomechanical demands can drive convergent morphological transformations. Thus, examining convergence helps to elucidate the key catalysts of phenotypic change. 
Gliding mammals are often presented as a classic case of convergent evolution because they independently evolved in numerous clades, each possessing patagia (""wing"" membranes) that generate lift during gliding. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether the skeletal morphologies of the six clades of extant gliding mammals demonstrate convergence. 
Our results indicate that glider skeletons are convergent, with glider groups consistently evolving proportionally longer, more gracile limbs than arborealists, likely to increase patagial surface area. Nonetheless, we interpret gliders to represent incomplete convergence because (1) evolutionary model-fitting analyses do not indicate strong selective pressures for glider trait optima, (2) the three marsupial glider groups diverge rather than converge, and (3) the gliding groups remain separated in morphospace (rather than converging on a single morphotype), which is reflected by an unexpectedly high level of morphological disparity. 
That glider skeletons are morphologically diverse is further demonstrated by fossil gliders from the Mesozoic Era, which possess unique skeletal characteristics that are absent in extant gliders. Glider morphologies may be strongly influenced by factors such as body size and attachment location of patagia on the forelimb, which can vary among clades. 
Thus, convergence in gliders appears to be driven by a simple lengthening of the limbs, whereas additional skeletal traits reflect nuances of the gliding apparatus that are distinct among different evolutionary lineages. Our unexpected results add to growing evidence that incomplete convergence is prevalent in vertebrate clades, even among classic cases of convergence, and they highlight the importance of examining form-function relationships in light of phylogeny, biomechanics, and the fossil record."
14;"Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) is a rare tumor, comprising less than 10% of sinonasal malignancies. SNMM most frequently occurs in the nasal cavity (70%) and maxillary sinus (14%), typically as black patches. Overall, SNMM harbors a very poor prognosis; 5-year survival is less than 30%. Nasal cavity tumors confer a better prognosis than sinus melanoma. 
The primary management for SNMM is surgery, when feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Recent studies suggest that immunotherapy may confer survival benefit to patients with advanced disease. The multidisciplinary team approach has been shown to optimize treatment, reduce costs, and minimize adverse events, while maximizing the chances for cure."
16;"Supplying phytolith-rich biochar in agrosystems increases soil pH, CEC and nutrient availability, adding to the impact of Si uptake on plant growth. Here we studied this specific impact as influenced by soil properties, and assessed the role of phytoliths to provide plant available Si. We used a young Cambisol and a highly weathered, poorly buffered, desilicated Nitisol. 
The biochars were produced from rice plants respectively enriched (Si+) and depleted (Si-) in Si. They had identical pH and nutrient contents, but largely differed in Si content (51.3 g Si kg−1 in Si + vs 0.3 g Si kg−1 in Si-). We compared their effects to that of wollastonite (CaSiO3) on the biomass and mineralomass of wheat plants in a soil:solution:plant device. 
The contents of soil bioavailable Si and biogenic Si were assessed through an original CaCl2 kinetic extraction and the DeMaster Na2CO3 alkaline dissolution, respectively. The DeMaster technique dissolved Si from phytolith as well as from wollastonite. The soil buffering capacity (cmolc kg−1) was 31 in the Cambisol and 0.2 in the Nitisol. 
An identical supply of phytolithic biochar increased pH from 4.5 to 4.8 in the Cambisol, and from 4.8 to 7.4 in NI. It further increased the content of bioavailable Si (from 55 to 97 mg kg−1 in the Cambisol, and 36 to 209 mg kg−1 in the Nitisol), as well as plant Si uptake, biomass and Si mineralomass. 
That increase was largest in the Nitisol. The DeMaster technique did not specifically quantify the phytolith pool. This pool was the main source of plant available Si in both the Cambisol and Nitisol amended with phytolithic biochar. At identical phytolithic Si supply, however, soil pH and soil buffering capacity controlled the transfer of Si in the soil-plant system, which was largest in the poorly buffered Nitisol. 
The effect of phytolithic biochar on Si bioavailability was depending on soil constituents and properties, and thus on soil type."
17;"Negative interactions between species can generate divergent selection that causes character displacement. However, other processes cause similar divergence. We use spatial and temporal replication across island populations of Anolis lizards to assess the importance of negative interactions in driving trait shifts. 
Previous work showed that the establishment of Anolis sagrei on islands drove resident Anolis carolinensis to perch higher and evolve larger toepads. To further test the interaction's causality and predictability, we resurveyed a subset of islands nine years later. Anolis sagrei had established on one island between surveys. 
We found that A. carolinensis on this island now perch higher and have larger toepads. However, toepad morphology change on this island was not distinct from shifts on six other islands whose Anolis community composition had not changed. Thus, the presence of A. sagrei only partly explains A. carolinensis trait variation across space and time. 
We also found that A. carolinensis on islands with previously established A. sagrei now perch higher than a decade ago, and that current A. carolinensis perch height is correlated with A. sagrei density. Our results suggest that character displacement likely interacts with other evolutionary processes in this system, and that temporal data are key to detecting such interactions."
19;"Scholars interested in the relationship between social context and health have recently turned attention further ""upstream"" to understand how political, social, and economic institutions shape the distribution of life chances across contexts. We compare minority health inequalities across 22 European countries ( N = 199,981) to investigate how two such arrangements-welfare state effort and immigrant incorporation policies-influence the distribution of health and health inequalities. 
We examine two measures of health from seven waves of the European Social Survey. Results from a series of multilevel mixed-effects models show that minority health inequalities vary across contexts and persist after accounting for socioeconomic differences. Cross-level interaction results show that welfare state effort is associated with better health for all groups but is unrelated to levels of inequality between groups. 
In contrast, policies aimed at protecting minorities from discrimination correlate with smaller relative health inequalities."
21;"Although congenital nonunion of the clavicle is a well-known pathology in children, posttraumatic nonunion is a rare entity. Nonunion after open reduction and internal fixation of a clavicle fracture is exceptional in the pediatric population. We report on a patient presenting posttraumatic pseudarthrosis of the clavicle after surgical treatment. 
Pseudarthrosis was resected, and the defect was bridged with an iliac crest autograft, supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein, and fixed with an elastic stable intramedullary nail. This procedure offered enough stability for achieving fracture consolidation and is a safe alternative to plating in clavicle nonunion."
22;"Nitric oxide increased lettuce's tolerance to salinity by restoring its hormonal balance, consequently reducing Na + accumulation and activating defense mechanisms that allowed the attenuation of ionic, oxidative, and osmotic stresses. Agricultural crops are continually threatened by soil salinity. The plant's ability to tolerate soil salinity can be increased by treatment with the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). 
Involvement of NO in plant metabolism and its interactions with phytohormones have not been fully described, so knowledge about the role of this radical in signaling pathways remains fragmented. In this work, Lactuca sativa (lettuce) plants were subjected to four treatments: (1) control (nutrient solution); (2) SNP [nutrient solution containing 70 μM sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor]; (3) NaCl (nutrient solution containing 80 mM NaCl); or (4) SNP + NaCl (nutrient solution containing SNP and NaCl). 
The plants were exposed to these conditions for 24 h, and then, the roots and leaves were collected and used to evaluate biochemical parameters (reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell membrane damage, cell death, antioxidant enzymes activities, and proline concentration), physiological parameters (pigments' concentration and gas-exchange measurements), and phytohormone content. 
To evaluate growth, tolerance index, and nutrient concentration, the plants were exposed to the treatments for 3 days. L sativa exposure to NaCl triggered ionic, osmotic, and oxidative stress, which resulted in hormone imbalance, cell death, and decreased growth. These deleterious changes were correlated with Na+ content in the vegetative tissues. 
Adding NO decreased Na+ accumulation and stabilized the mineral nutrient concentration, which maintained the photosynthetic rate and re-established growth. NO-signaling action also re-established the phytohormones balance and resulted in antioxidant system activation and osmotic regulation, with consequent increase in plants tolerance to the salt."
24;"The axillary lymph node status is an important prognostic factor of breast cancer. This study explores the predictive factors for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis among the preoperative clinicopathological features, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). This study comprised patients diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent surgery at Nagasaki Harbor Medical Center between April 2014 and December 2019. 
The factors assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses were the clinicopathological data of these cancers, including the patient age, gender, menstrual status, breast or ovarian cancer family history, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, clinical tumor size, nipple-tumor distance (NTD), tumor histology, histological grade, node status, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 status, and Ki67 labeling index. 
In the cohort of 313 cases, the ratio of SLN metastasis was 17.3%. A univariate analysis found that the tumor size, NTD, IGT, and clinical tumor stage were associated with SLN metastasis. In a multivariable analysis, the tumor size, NTD, and IGT were associated with SLN metastasis. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a sensitivity and specificity of 61.1% and 65.6%, respectively, at a cut-off of 1.7 cm for the tumor size (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.664; 95% confidence interval: 0.592-0.736), and a sensitivity and specificity of 60.4% and 62.9%, respectively, at a cut-off of 2.0 cm for NTD (AUC: 0.651; 95% confidence interval: 0.571-0.731) to predict the risk of SLN metastasis. 
T1 and T2 breast cancer patients with a larger tumor size, tumor located closer to the nipple, and IGT have a higher risk of SLN metastases than others."
25;"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the largest type of lung cancer (LC) with a higher mortality rate. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in cancer progression. Therefore, this study was to explore the function of hsa_circ_0043265 in NSCLC. The expression levels of hsa_circ_0043265, microRNA-25-3p (miR-25-3p) and forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 
Ribonuclease R (RNase R) and Actinomycin D (ActD) were used to verify the authenticity and stability of hsa_circ_0043265. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry and transwell assays were used to evaluate the abilities of proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Also, Western blot (WB) analysis was performed to assess the levels of apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferation-related proteins and FOXP2 protein. 
RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to verify the interaction between miR-25-3p and hsa_circ_0043265 or FOXP2. Besides, mice xenograft models were constructed to confirm the effect of hsa_circ_0043265 on NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Hsa_circ_0043265 was lowly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cells, and its overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT process, while improved the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. 
MiR-25-3p could be sponged by hsa_circ_0043265, and its overexpression could invert the suppression effect of overexpressed-hsa_circ_0043265 on NSCLC progression. Moreover, FOXP2 was a target of miR-25-3p, and its silencing also could reverse the inhibition effect of overexpressed-hsa_circ_0043265 on NSCLC progression. 
In addition, hsa_circ_0043265 overexpression reduced the tumor growth of NSCLC in vivo. Hsa_circ_0043265 could sponge miR-25-3p to improve FOXP2 expression, thereby inhibiting NSCLC progression. This study showed that hsa_circ_0043265 could be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of NSCLC."
26;"Childhood maltreatment (CM) comprises experiences of abuse and neglect during childhood. CM causes psychological as well as biological alterations in affected individuals. In humans, it is hardly explored whether these CM consequences can be transmitted directly on a biological level to the next generation. 
Here, we investigated the associations between maternal CM and mitochondrial bioenergetics (mitochondrial respiration and intracellular mitochondrial density) in immune cells of mothers and compared them with those of their newborns. In n = 102 healthy mother-newborn dyads, maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neonatal umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were collected and cryopreserved shortly after parturition to measure mitochondrial respiration and intracellular mitochondrial density with high-resolution respirometry and spectrophotometric analyses, respectively. 
Maternal CM was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Maternal and neonatal mitochondrial bioenergetics were quantitatively comparable and positively correlated. Female newborns showed higher mitochondrial respiration compared to male newborns. Maternal CM load was significantly and positively associated with mitochondrial respiration and density in mothers, but not with mitochondrial respiration in newborns. 
Although maternal and neonatal mitochondrial bioenergetics were positively correlated, maternal CM only had a small effect on mitochondrial density in newborns, which was not significant in this study after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The biological relevance of our finding and its consequences for child development need further investigation in future larger studies. 
This study reports data on mitochondrial bioenergetics of healthy mother-newborn dyads with varying degrees of CM."
31;"Plants regularly encounter patchily distributed soil nutrients. A common foraging response is to proliferate roots within high-quality patches. The influence of the social environment on this behaviour has been given limited attention, despite important fitness consequences of competition for soil resources among plants. 
Using the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), we compared localized root proliferation in a high-quality patch by plants grown alone to that of plants in two different social environments: with a neighbouring plant sharing equal access to the high-quality patch, and with a neighbouring plant present but farther from the high-quality patch such that the focal individual was in closer proximity to the high-quality patch. 
Sunflowers grown alone proliferated more roots within high-nutrient patches than lower-nutrient soil. Plants decreased root proliferation within a high-nutrient patch when it was equidistant to a neighbour. Conversely, plants increased root proliferation when they were in closer proximity to the patch relative to a nearby neighbour. 
Such contingent responses may allow sunflowers to avoid competition in highly contested patches, but to also pre-empt soil resources from neighbours when they have better access to a high-quality patch. We also compared patch occupancy by sunflowers grown alone with two equidistant high-quality patches to occupancy by sunflowers grown with two high-quality patches and a neighbour. 
Plants grown with a neighbour decreased root length within shared patches but did not increase root length within high-quality patches they were in closer proximity to, perhaps because resource pre-emption may be less important for individuals when resources are more abundant. These results show that nutrient foraging responses in plants can be socially contingent, and that plants may account for the possibility of pre-empting limited resources in their foraging decisions."
32;"In this study, we examine investor and firm response to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (CTSCA) of 2010. The CTSCA requires large retail and manufacturing firms to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains and is a rare example of mandated corporate social responsibility disclosure. 
Based on a sample of 105 retail companies subject to the CTSCA, we find a significant negative market reaction to the passing of the CTSCA. Furthermore, we find that the reaction is significantly more negative for larger firms and companies facing greater supply chain risks (apparel and footwear retailers), suggesting that investors place a negative value on exposure to legitimacy threats in the social domain. 
With respect to company disclosure response, we document relatively high compliance with the legislation, although we also find that the disclosure response appeared to be more symbolic than substantive in nature. Finally, our analysis indicates that both disclosure choice and disclosure extensiveness were significantly higher for the high-supply chain risk companies, suggesting that the response was influenced by concerns with strategic legitimation. 
Overall, the limited quality of disclosure suggests that, without additional rules and guidance, mandates alone may not lead to meaningful social disclosure."
33;"Healthcare systems in the United States have increasingly turned toward the use of disposable medical equipment in an attempt to save time, lower costs, and reduce the transmission of infections. However, the use of disposable instruments is associated with increased solid waste production and may have negative impacts on the environment, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions. 
The purpose of this study was to inform this discussion; we applied life cycle assessment methods to evaluate the carbon footprints of 3 vaginal specula: a single-use acrylic model and 2 reusable stainless steel models. The functional unit of the study was defined as the completion of 20 gynecologic examinations by either type of speculum. 
The greenhouse gas emissions (eg, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) across all life cycle stages, which includes material production and manufacturing, transportation, use and reprocessing, and end-of-life, were analyzed with the use of SimaPro life cycle assessment software and converted into carbon dioxide equivalents. 
The reusable stainless steel grade 304 speculum was found to have a lesser carbon footprint over multiple model scenarios (different reprocessing techniques, autoclave loading/efficiency, and number of uses) than either the reusable stainless steel grade 316 or the disposable acrylic specula. The material production and manufacturing phase contributed most heavily to the total life cycle carbon footprint of the acrylic speculum, whereas the use and reprocessing phase contributed most to the carbon footprints of both stainless steel specula. 
The use of disposable vaginal specula is associated with increased greenhouse gas equivalents compared with reusable alternatives with no significant difference in clinical utility. These findings can be used to inform decision-making by healthcare systems, because they weigh a wide range of considerations in making final purchase decisions; similar analytic methods can and should be applied to other components of health systems' waste streams."
34;"Although methotrexate (MTX) is an effective immunosuppressive and anti-cancer agent, it is associated with side effects, including nephrotoxicity. Capsaicin, a component of hot chilli peppers, induces rapid desensitization of TRPV1 pain receptors and therefore has uses in pain treatment. Capsaicin also has anti-cancer activity, including anti-inflammatory properties. 
Thus, capsaicin may have potential in preventing MTX-induced nephrotoxicity. The purpose of this research work was to observe protective effects of capsaicin towards renal toxicity caused by methotrexate and mechanisms responsible for these effects. As expected, capsaicin had nephroprotective effects in MTX-intoxicated rats. 
Serum creatinine urea, nitric oxide (NO) and renal malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased significantly, with a concurrent increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and renal glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities as compared to rats that had been untreated with nephrotoxic. Biochemical analyses confirmed the protective effects of capsaicin. 
We conclude that capsaicin provides protection against MTX-nephrotoxicity in rats via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities."
35;"Atherosclerosis is a major cardiovascular disease that causes ischemia of the heart, brain, or extremities, and can lead to infarction. The hypolipidemic agent atorvastatin calcium (Ato) alleviates atherosclerosis by reducing plasma lipid and inflammatory factors. However, the low bioavailability of Ato limits its widespread use and clinical effectiveness. 
Curcumin (Cur), a natural polyphenol with antioxidation and anti-inflammation bioactivities, has potential anti-atherosclerosis activity and may reduce Ato-induced cytotoxicity. Liposomes modified using a targeting ligand (E-selectin-binding peptide) were prepared to co-deliver Ato and Cur to dysfunctional endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing E-selectin. 
Molecules involved in the inhibition of adhesion (E-selectin and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) and inflammation (IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP-1]) in human aortic endothelial cells were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining. 
The antiatherosclerosis effects of liposomes co-loaded with Ato and Cur in vivo were evaluated using ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. Targeted liposomes delivered Ato and Cur to dysfunctional ECs, resulting in synergistic suppression of adhesion molecules (E-selectin and ICAM-1) and plasma lipid levels. 
Moreover, this treatment reduced foam cell formation and the secretion of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and MCP-1) by blocking monocyte migration into the intima. In addition, Cur successfully reduced Ato-inducible cytotoxicity. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that cell-targeted co-delivery of Ato and Cur to dysfunctional ECs drastically reduces atherosclerotic lesions with fewer side effects than either Ato or Cur alone."
38;"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine or immune globulin (IG) effectively prevents infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) when administered within 2 weeks of exposure. Preexposure prophylaxis against HAV infection through the administration of HepA vaccine or IG provides protection for unvaccinated persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate HAV endemicity. 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence for administering vaccine for PEP to persons aged >40 years and reviewed the HepA vaccine efficacy and safety in infants and the benefits of protection against HAV before international travel. 
The February 21, 2018, ACIP recommendations update and supersede previous ACIP recommendations for HepA vaccine for PEP and for international travel. Current recommendations include that HepA vaccine should be administered to all persons aged ≥12 months for PEP. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be administered to persons aged >40 years depending on the provider's risk assessment. 
ACIP also recommended that HepA vaccine be administered to infants aged 6-11 months traveling outside the United States when protection against HAV is recommended. The travel-related dose for infants aged 6-11 months should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose series. The dosage of IG has been updated where applicable (0.1 mL/kg). 
HepA vaccine for PEP provides advantages over IG, including induction of active immunity, longer duration of protection, ease of administration, and greater acceptability and availability."
44;"What causes the disparity in biodiversity among regions is a fundamental question in biogeography, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Evolutionary and biogeographic processes (speciation, extinction, dispersal) directly determine species richness patterns, and can be studied using integrative phylogenetic approaches. 
However, the strikingly high richness of East Asia relative to other Northern Hemisphere regions remains poorly understood from this perspective. Here, for the first time, we test two general hypotheses (older colonization time, faster diversification rate) to explain this pattern, using the plant tribe Lysimachieae (Primulaceae) as a model system. 
We generated a new time-calibrated phylogeny for Lysimachieae (13 genes, 126 species), to estimate colonization times and diversification rates for each region and to test the relative importance of these two factors for explaining regional richness patterns. We find that neither time nor diversification rates alone explain richness patterns among regions in Lysimachieae. 
Instead, a new index that combines both factors explains global richness patterns in the group and their high East Asian biodiversity. Based on our results from Lysimachieae, we suggest that the high richness of plants in East Asia may be explained by a combination of older colonization times and faster diversification rates in this region."
46;"Increasing global atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has a considerable impact on soil respiration. Due to different carbon dioxide (CO2) resources of different components of soil respiration, there may be different mechanisms by which soils respond to N additions. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of N additions on total soil respiration (RST), rhizospheric respiration (RSR) and heterotrophic respiration (RSH), and to elucidate the potential causal mechanisms. 
An artificial N addition experiment was conducted in an evergreen broad-leaved forest at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin in China. The effects of three N treatment levels (+0, +50, +150 kg N ha−1 yr.−1) were measured, with the N application initiated in April 2013. Trenching method was used for partitioning RST into RST and RSR. 
The values of RST and its components were measured monthly from May 2015 to April 2016. The mean annual RST was 1.92 ± 0.18 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1, with RSH and RSR contributing 75 ± 1% and 25 ± 1% to RST, respectively. Nitrogen addition significantly reduced RST and its two components, as well as the contribution of RSR to RST. 
Microbial biomass carbon (C) and pH in bulk soil decreased significantly after N application. Nitrogen addition had no effect on rhizospheric soil biochemical properties. RSR was significantly positively correlated with root biomass of Castanopsis platyacantha, while RSH was significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN) for bulk soil. 
The positive correlation between RSR and root biomass indicates that N application reduced RSR by reducing belowground C allocation and thus C inputs to the rhizosphere. The value of RSH decreased primarily due to a reduction in microbial activity and soil organic matter decomposition in root-free soil after N was added. 
The presence of plant roots may mitigate the effect of N inputs to the rhizosphere via alteration of root morphology and exudates."
47;"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. 
Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. 
COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases. 
Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks."
48;"The biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis causes smut disease on maize (Zea mays), which is characterized by immense plant tumours. To establish disease and reprogram organ primordia to tumours, U. maydis deploys effector proteins in an organ-specific manner. However, the cellular contribution to leaf tumours remains unknown. 
We investigated leaf tumour formation at the tissue- and cell type-specific levels. Cytology and metabolite analysis were deployed to understand the cellular basis for tumourigenesis. Laser-capture microdissection was performed to gain a cell type-specific transcriptome of U. maydis during tumour formation. 
In vivo visualization of plant DNA synthesis identified bundle sheath cells as the origin of hyperplasic tumour cells, while mesophyll cells become hypertrophic tumour cells. Cell type-specific transcriptome profiling of U. maydis revealed tailored expression of fungal effector genes. Moreover, U. maydis See1 was identified as the first cell type-specific fungal effector, being required for induction of cell cycle reactivation in bundle sheath cells. 
Identification of distinct cellular mechanisms in two different leaf cell types and of See1 as an effector for induction of proliferation of bundle sheath cells are major steps in understanding U. maydis-induced tumour formation. Moreover, the cell type-specific U. maydis transcriptome data are a valuable resource to the scientific community."
49;"Radium-223 (Ra223) prolongs the survival and improves the quality of life of men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to bones. However, compared to other mCRPC therapies, using Ra223 comes with its unique challenges. Hence, we aimed to identify Ra223 utilization patterns under real-world conditions, as well as factors predicting treatment completion and outcome. 
In this retrospective chart analysis, 198 mCRPC patients were identified that had received Ra223 outside of clinical trials or access programs from January 2015 to October 2016 at four cancer centres in Ontario. The main outcomes studied were Ra223 completion rate, reasons for early treatment discontinuation, overall survival, and survival differences in patients completing Ra223 therapy versus patients receiving <6 cycles of Ra223. 
In addition, patient and disease characteristics were analysed to identify predictors of treatment completion and survival. In this cohort of patients mostly pretreated with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (92.4%), almost half of which had also received docetaxel (48.5%), the Ra223 completion rate was 46.5%, and the actuarial median survival was 13.3 months. 
The main reason for early Ra223 discontinuation was disease progression, and Ra223 non-completion was associated with poorer outcome (median survival 8.1 months [6.0-12.2] versus 18.7 months [15.3-22.3] in men completing Ra223, p<0.0001). Lymph node metastases and a high baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were independent predictors of early treatment discontinuation. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models revealed early Ra223 discontinuation, baseline anemia, high PSA, prior skeletal-related events, visceral metastases, and being referred to another centre for Ra223 therapy as predictors of worse outcome. Despite a lower completion rate than observed under clinical trial conditions, the real-world results achieved with Ra223 are encouraging. 
If prospectively validated, predictive patient and disease characteristics identified in our cohort might become instrumental to identify mCRPC patients likely to complete and to most benefit from Ra223 therapy."
53;"Visual signals attractive to friends may also attract enemies.  The bright colors of anthers and pollen have generally been thought to attract pollinators. We hypothesize that visual crypsis of anthers, and particularly pollen, should be favored in flowering plants because protection from pollen collectors reduces the loss of male gametes. 
To understand adaptive strategies relating to the color of pollen, we measured the color of pollen, undehisced anther sacs, and their background, the corolla, with a spectrometer for 104 insect-pollinated flowering species from a natural community in Hengduan Mountains, southwest China. The colors of anthers, pollen and corollas were diverse in these species. 
The color diversity of exposed pollen was significantly higher than that of concealed pollen (i.e. where anthers are enclosed or shielded by corollas). The color contrast between pollen and corolla was significantly smaller in species with exposed pollen than in those with concealed pollen. Unlike anther color, exposed pollen color tended to match its background corolla color. 
Our phylogenetic comparative analysis showed contrasting effects of pollen color patterns between flowers with exposed pollen and those with concealed pollen, revealing a strategy of hiding pollen from pollen thieves via visual crypsis."
59;"Human malignancies are often the result of overexpressed and constitutively active receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which ultimately lead to the mediation of key tumor-driven pathways. Several tyrosine kinases (ie, EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR), are aberrantly activated in most common tumors, including leukemia, glioblastoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer, and head and neck cancers. 
Iclusig™ (ponatinib, previously known as AP24534) is an orally active multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, specifically targeting the BCR-ABL gene mutation, T315I. 
Due to ponatinib's unique multi-targeted characteristics, further studies have demonstrated its ability to target other important tyrosine kinases (FGFR, PDGFR, SRC, RET, KIT, and FLT1) in other human malignancies. This review focuses on the available data of ponatinib and its molecular targets for treatment in various cancers, with a discussion on the broader potential of this agent in other cancer indications."
62;"To make research responsible and research outcomes meaningful, it is necessary to communicate our research and to involve as many relevant stakeholders as possible, especially in application-oriented-including information and communications technology (ICT)-research. Nowadays, stakeholder engagement is of fundamental importance to project success and achieving the expected impact and is often mandatory in a third-party funding context. 
Ultimately, research and development can only be successful if people react positively to the results and benefits generated by a project. For the wider acceptance of research outcomes, it is therefore essential that the public is made aware of and has an opportunity to discuss the results of research undertaken through two-way communication (interpersonal communication) with researchers. 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations regarding research and innovation, aims to foster inclusive and sustainable research and innovation. Research and innovation processes need to become more responsive and adaptive to these grand challenges. 
This implies, among other things, the introduction of broader foresight and impact assessments for new technologies beyond their anticipated market benefits and risks. Therefore, this article provides a structured workflow that explains ""how to develop a stakeholder engagement plan"" step by step."
69;"Gendered differences in career paths of medical graduates persist globally. We aim to explore the impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of physicians by studying gendered differences in domestic burdens of physicians as well as differences in perceptions around the impact of domestic work on professional advancement. 
A web-based survey including 38 questions was sent to all 3866 physician alumni of the top academic medical school in Lebanon. Data was collected between November 2018 and January 2019, with up to three invite reminders. Overall, 382 were included in the final analysis, 124 women (32%), 258 men (68%). 
The study had a response rate of 10.4%. Findings show that a greater percentage of men were married and had children (77.5% vs 62.1%, p = 0.004, 77.9% vs 51.6%, <0.001, respectively). Majority of both women and men held full-time positions (82.1% and 87.1%), having children however reduced the odds significantly [OR = 0.2, 95% CI: (0.1–0.6), p = 0.01]for women, while only older age reduced it for men (OR = 0.1,95% CI: (0.04–0.2), p<0.001]. 
Among full-time physicians, men and women spent similar time on professional activities (60.2hrs/wk vs 58.3hrs/wk, p = 0.32). Women spent more time on parenting and household work (23.5hrs/wk vs 10.4hrs/wk, <0.001; 8.9hrs/wk vs 6.0hrs/wk, p = 0.001, respectively). Women physicians’ spouses contributed to 14.5 hours/week of total time on domestic activities whereas men physicians’ spouses spent two folds more time on domestic activities (35.0 hours/week, P<0.001). 
Of physicians with children, a higher percentage of women than men reported that children prevented their career advancement or their participation in development opportunities (43.8% vs 15.9%, p<0.001; 50.0% vs 19.4%, p<0.001, respectively). A greater percentage of women than men scaled back their career after first child (31.3% vs 3.5%, <0.001). 
Of married/partnered physicians, fewer women than men reported their career took priority over their partner’s when conflicts arose, (52.0% vs 86.0%, p<0.001). These findings highlight the heavier impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of women physicians than men physicians. Men are more likely than women to hold full-time positions in the early advancement defining phases of their careers. 
Full-time women shoulder more domestic work than men and experience more professional advancement concessions. Closing persistent gender gaps in medicine requires addressing inequities in domestic burdens through strategies that include mentorship on domestic tethers, support of on-site child-care and advocacy for parental leave policies that encourage shared care-work."
72;"Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer, with an impressive efficacy and safety profile. Cytopenia is the main adverse event, which is both predictable and manageable. 
Here, we report a case of CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced vitiligo-like lesions. Vitiligo or vitiligo-like lesions are a rare adverse event; only a few cases are reported in the literature. A 71-year-old female patient was diagnosed initially with early-stage right breast cancer (HR+/HER2-) and was treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. 
A few years later, she developed metastatic disease to the hilar lymph nodes, and to multiple skeletal sites, including the left scapula, left shoulder, left iliac bone, and dorsal vertebrae, for which she was treated with ribociclib and letrozole. While on treatment, she developed hypopigmented lesions involving both hands, feet, and face, which were described as vitiligo-like lesions. 
CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced vitiligo is a rare and unpredictable adverse event. This case report highlights the rarity of this adverse event, the dilemma related to the optimal treatment, and decisions related to continuation, holding, or switching CDK4/6 inhibitors."
78;"We investigate the quantum thermodynamical properties of localised relativistic quantum fields, and how they can be used as quantum thermal machines. We study the efficiency and power of energy transfer between the classical gravitational degrees of freedom, such as the energy input due to the motion of boundaries or an impinging gravitational wave, and the excitations of a confined quantum field. 
We find that the efficiency of energy transfer depends dramatically on the input initial state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of the system to extract energy from a gravitational wave and store it in a battery. This process is inefficient in optical cavities but is significantly enhanced when employing trapped Bose Einstein condensates. 
We also employ standard fluctuation results to obtain the work probability distribution, which allows us to understand how the efficiency is related to the dissipation of work. Finally, we apply our techniques to a setup where an impinging gravitational wave excites the phononic modes of a Bose Einstein condensate. 
We find that, in this case, the percentage of energy transferred to the phonons approaches unity after a suitable amount of time. These results give a quantitative insight into the thermodynamic behaviour of relativistic quantum fields confined in cavities."
79;"Policy Points Social prescribing is proposed as a way of improving patients' health and well-being by attending to their non-clinical needs. This is done by connecting patients with community assets (typically voluntary or charitable organizations) that provide social and personal support. In the United Kingdom, social prescribing is used to improve patient well-being and reduce use of National Health Service resources. 
Although social prescribing schemes hold promise, evidence of their effects and effectiveness is sparse. As more information on social prescribing is gathered, it will be important to consider the associated ethical issues for patients, clinicians, link workers, and community assets."
81;"Reviewing the results of several decades of excavation in the center of Melbourne, Australia, provides the opportunity to reflect on what archaeological evidence has to contribute to understandings of the colonial city. The city has been shaped by its role as a colonial entrepot, a gold rush port, and a nineteenth-century metropolitan center. 
Its rich archaeological record derives from the intersection of heritage controls and a development boom. Data from archaeological excavations drives new perspectives on Melbourne itself, revealing a city intimately connected with the gold rush boom that fuelled its growth. Archaeological data also shed light on the specific and distinctive historical circumstances that influenced the development of cities established in the nineteenth century, including transnational migration and trade along with emerging concerns over public health and sanitation."
83;"Healthcare professionals may have certain psychological characteristics which contribute to increasing the quality of their professional performance. Study the effect that humanization of care and communication have on the burnout syndrome in nursing personal. The sample included a total of 330 Spanish nurses. 
Analytical instruments used were the Health Professional's Humanization Scale (HUMAS), Communication Styles Inventory Revised (CSI-R) and Brief Burnout Questionnaire Revised (CBB-R). Two broad nursing profiles could be differentiated by their level of humanization (those with scores over the mean and those with scores below it in optimistic disposition, openness to sociability, emotional understanding, self-efficacy, and affection), where the largest group had the high scores. 
A communication repertoire based on verbal aggressiveness impacted indirectly on the effect of humanization on burnout, mainly in the personal impact component. We observed the relation of humanization profiles in nursing staff with the job dissatisfaction and burnout components. Besides that, some communication styles, verbal aggressiveness and questioningness, have an indirect effect on the relationship between humanization profiles and job dissatisfaction. 
The results on the relationship between communication styles and burnout, and the mediator effect of communication styles on the relationship between humanization of care and burnout in nursing personnel are discussed."
92;"Some people experience prolonged symptoms following an acute COVID-19 infection including fatigue, chest pain and breathlessness, headache and cognitive impairment. When symptoms persist for over 12 weeks following the initial infection, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis, the term post-COVID-19 syndrome is used, or the patient-defined term of Long Covid. 
Understanding the lived experiences of Long Covid is crucial to supporting its management. However, research on patient experiences of Long Covid is currently not ethnically diverse enough. The study aim is to explore the lived experience of Long Covid, using qualitative interviews and art-based methods, among people from ethnically diverse backgrounds (in the UK), to better understand wider systems of support and healthcare support needs. 
Co-created artwork will be used to build on the interview findings. A purposive sampling strategy will be used to gain diverse experiences of Long Covid, sampling by demographics, geographic locations and experiences of Long Covid. Individuals (aged >18 years) from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds, who self-report Long Covid symptoms, will be invited to take part in a semi-structured interview. 
Interviews will be analysed thematically. A sub-sample of participants will be invited to co-create visual artwork to further explore shared narratives of Long Covid, enhance storytelling and increase understanding about the condition. A patient advisory group, representing diversity in ethnicity and experiences of Long Covid, will inform all research stages. 
Stakeholder workshops with healthcare professionals and persons, systems or networks important to people's management of Long Covid, will advise on the integration of findings to inform management of Long Covid. The study will use patient narratives from people from diverse ethnic backgrounds, to raise awareness of Long Covid and help inform management of Long Covid and how wider social systems and networks may inform better healthcare service access and experiences."
93;"Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules have several functions in pancreatic islets, including provision of mechanical support and prevention of cytotoxicity during inflammation. During islet isolation, ECM connections are damaged, and are not restored after encapsulation and transplantation. Inclusion of specific combinations of collagen type IV and laminins in immunoisolating capsules can enhance survival of pancreatic islets. 
Here we investigated whether ECM can also enhance survival and lower susceptibility of human islets to cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity. To this end, human islets were encapsulated in alginate with collagen IV and either RGD, LRE or PDSGR, i.e. laminin sequences. Islets in capsules without ECM served as control. 
The encapsulated islets were exposed to IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α for 24 and 72 h. All combinations of ECM improved the islet cell survival, and reduced necrosis and apoptosis after cytokine exposure (P < 0.01). Collagen IV-RGD and collagen IV-LRE reduced danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release from islets (P < 0.05). 
Moreover, collagen IV-RGD and collagen IV-PDSGR, but not collagen IV-LRE, reduced NO release from encapsulated human islets (P < 0.05). This reduction correlated with a higher oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of islets in capsules containing collagen IV-RGD and collagen IV-PDSGR. Islets in capsules with collagen IV-LRE showed more dysfunction, and OCR was not different from islets in control capsules without ECM. 
Our study demonstrates that incorporation of specific ECM molecules such as collagen type IV with the laminin sequences RGD and PDSGR in immunoisolated islets can protect against cytokine toxicity."
95;"The question of how the probabilistic opinions of different individuals should be aggregated to form a group opinion is controversial. But one assumption seems to be pretty much common ground: for a group of Bayesians, the representation of group opinion should itself be a unique probability distribution (Madansky [44]; Lehrer and Wagner [34]; McConway Journal of the American Statistical Association, 76(374), 410–414, [45]; Bordley Management Science, 28(10), 1137–1148, [5]; Genest et al. 
The Annals of Statistics, 487–501, [21]; Genest and Zidek Statistical Science, 114–135, [23]; Mongin Journal of Economic Theory, 66(2), 313–351, [46]; Clemen and Winkler Risk Analysis, 19(2), 187–203, [7]; Dietrich and List [14]; Herzberg Theory and Decision, 1–19, [28]). We argue that this assumption is not always in order. 
We show how to extend the canonical mathematical framework for pooling to cover pooling with imprecise probabilities (IP) by employing set-valued pooling functions and generalizing common pooling axioms accordingly. As a proof of concept, we then show that one IP construction satisfies a number of central pooling axioms that are not jointly satisfied by any of the standard pooling recipes on pain of triviality. 
Following Levi (Synthese, 62(1), 3–11, [39]), we also argue that IP models admit of a much better philosophical motivation as a model of rational consensus."
97;"Late-maturity alpha-amylase (LMA) is a wheat genetic defect causing the synthesis of high isoelectric point alpha-amylase following a temperature shock during mid-grain development or prolonged cold throughout grain development, both leading to starch degradation. While the physiology is well understood, the biochemical mechanisms involved in grain LMA response remain unclear. 
We have applied high-throughput proteomics to 4,061 wheat flours displaying a range of LMA activities. Using an array of statistical analyses to select LMA-responsive biomarkers, we have mined them using a suite of tools applicable to wheat proteins. We observed that LMA-affected grains activated their primary metabolisms such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; TCA cycle, along with DNA- and RNA- binding mechanisms; and protein translation. 
This logically transitioned to protein folding activities driven by chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, as well as protein assembly via dimerisation and complexing. The secondary metabolism was also mobilized with the upregulation of phytohormones and chemical and defence responses. LMA further invoked cellular structures, including ribosomes, microtubules, and chromatin. 
Finally, and unsurprisingly, LMA expression greatly impacted grain storage proteins, as well as starch and other carbohydrates, with the upregulation of alpha-gliadins and starch metabolism, whereas LMW glutenin, stachyose, sucrose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-glucose were downregulated. To our knowledge, this is not only the first proteomics study tackling the wheat LMA issue but also the largest plant-based proteomics study published to date. 
Logistics, technicalities, requirements, and bottlenecks of such an ambitious large-scale high-throughput proteomics experiment along with the challenges associated with big data analyses are discussed."
102;"Plant functional traits regulate ecosystem functions but little is known about how co-occurring gradients of land use and edaphic conditions influence their expression. We test how gradients of logging disturbance and soil properties relate to community-weighted mean traits in logged and old-growth tropical forests in Borneo. 
We studied 32 physical, chemical and physiological traits from 284 tree species in eight 1 ha plots and measured long-term soil nutrient supplies and plant-available nutrients. Logged plots had greater values for traits that drive carbon capture and growth, whilst old-growth forests had greater values for structural and persistence traits. 
Although disturbance was the primary driver of trait expression, soil nutrients explained a statistically independent axis of variation linked to leaf size and nutrient concentration. Soil characteristics influenced trait expression via nutrient availability, nutrient pools, and pH. Our finding, that traits have dissimilar responses to land use and soil resource availability, provides robust evidence for the need to consider the abiotic context of logging when predicting plant functional diversity across human-modified tropical forests. 
The detection of two independent axes was facilitated by the measurement of many more functional traits than have been examined in previous studies."
103;"Neurological COVID-19 disease has been reported widely, but published studies often lack information on neurological outcomes and prognostic risk factors. We aimed to describe the spectrum of neurological disease in hospitalised COVID-19 patients; characterise clinical outcomes; and investigate factors associated with a poor outcome. 
We conducted an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of hospitalised patients with neurological COVID-19 disease, using standard case definitions. We invited authors of studies from the first pandemic wave, plus clinicians in the Global COVID-Neuro Network with unpublished data, to contribute. 
We analysed features associated with poor outcome (moderate to severe disability or death, 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin Scale) using multivariable models. We included 83 studies (31 unpublished) providing IPD for 1979 patients with COVID-19 and acute new-onset neurological disease. Encephalopathy (978 [49%] patients) and cerebrovascular events (506 [26%]) were the most common diagnoses. 
Respiratory and systemic symptoms preceded neurological features in 93% of patients; one third developed neurological disease after hospital admission. A poor outcome was more common in patients with cerebrovascular events (76% [95% CI 67–82]), than encephalopathy (54% [42–65]). Intensive care use was high (38% [35–41]) overall, and also greater in the cerebrovascular patients. 
In the cerebrovascular, but not encephalopathic patients, risk factors for poor outcome included breathlessness on admission and elevated D-dimer. Overall, 30-day mortality was 30% [27–32]. The hazard of death was comparatively lower for patients in the WHO European region. Neurological COVID-19 disease poses a considerable burden in terms of disease outcomes and use of hospital resources from prolonged intensive care and inpatient admission; preliminary data suggest these may differ according to WHO regions and country income levels. 
The different risk factors for encephalopathy and stroke suggest different disease mechanisms which may be amenable to intervention, especially in those who develop neurological symptoms after hospital admission."
105;"This paper analyzes an emergent stream of research shedding light on the institutional factors shaping entrepreneurial activity and its effect on economic growth. This integrative analysis spanning a broad spectrum of diverse literature enables a distinction between two different research lines in the field of entrepreneurship. 
The findings of this study, based on articles from the journals included in the Web of Science database, facilitate a broader comprehension of two separate lines of research, which allows an analysis of the interaction among institutions, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. The systematic literature analysis over the last 25 years (1992–2016) of research reveals that institutions could be related to economic growth through entrepreneurship, which would open new research questions about what institutional factors are conducive to entrepreneurship, which in turn spurs economic growth. 
Thus, not only is understanding both complex relationships and their possible sequence useful for planning strategies and public policies, but it is also helpful for advancing and providing new insights in these research fields, which could be complementary and interdisciplinary."
